**Namaste`** üôè **Hello** üëã

I am a **Machine Learning Research Associate II** at **[MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/)**. I am working at the intersection of probabilistic generative modelling, specifically [GFlowNets](https://yoshuabengio.org/2022/03/05/generative-flow-networks/) and CyberSecurity. 

Previously, I was an Research Associate at **[University of Waterloo Research](https://uwaterloo.ca/autonomous-vehicle-research-intelligence-lab/)** with **[AVL](https://www.avl.com/en)**, where I developed adversarial testing framework for autonomous vehicles under [Dr. Sebastian Fischmesiter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sfischmeister?originalSubdomain=ca) and [Dr. Nasser Azad](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/profile/nlashgar). 

I earned my master's in computer science at the **[University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/)**. I researched safeguarding vision models against physical adversaries [(find here)](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0435778?o=0) under the supervision of [Dr. Apurva Narayan](https://a-narayan.github.io/).  I was an [MITACS Accelerate](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/accelerate) intern with **[Troj AI Inc](https://troj.ai/)**. 

During my undergrad, I was also privileged to be part of **[COEP-SAT-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swayam)**, a satellite initiative, where I worked on the priliminary control system design. I received my bachelor's in Instrumentation and Control Engineering with the *Gold Medal* at the **[College of Engineering, Pune](https://www.coep.org.in/)**, India. I also worked shortly as a Decision Analytics Associate at **[ZS Associates](https://www.zs.com/)**

In my leisure time, I like playing squash, swimming, and reading history and its impact on modern culture.
