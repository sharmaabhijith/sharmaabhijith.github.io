**Namaste`** üôè **Hello** üëã

I am an Associate Research Engineer at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/autonomous-vehicle-research-intelligence-lab/) Research with [AVL](https://www.avl.com/en), working on building adversarial testing framework for autonomous vehicles. I am also a part-time ML developer with [Palitronica](https://www.palitronica.com/).

Previously, I was a thesis-based master's in computer science student at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/). I researched safeguarding vision models against physical adversaries [(find here)](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0435778?o=0) under the supervision of [Dr. Apurva Narayan](https://a-narayan.github.io/).  I was an [MITACS Accelerate](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/accelerate) intern with [Troj AI Inc](https://troj.ai/). where I worked under the mentorship of Phil Munz. I am passionate about building reliable/robust AI models for safety critical applications.

Before I joined UBC, I was a Decision Analytics Associate at [ZS Associates](https://www.zs.com/). I was also privileged to be part of [COEP-SAT-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swayam) where I worked on the priliminary control system design. I received my bachelor's in Instrumentation and Control Engineering with the *Gold Medal* at the [College of Engineering, Pune](https://www.coep.org.in/), India. 

In my leisure time, I like playing squash. Since last year, I have also been invested in learning world history and its impact on modern culture.
