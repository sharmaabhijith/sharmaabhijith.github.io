My research interests lie in developing robust and trustworthy AI systems under uncertainty. I focus on **generative flow networks**, **adversarial robustness**, **decision-making frameworks**, and **evaluation strategies for neural models**, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving and security-sensitive AI applications. My work spans the development of novel testing frameworks, defense strategies, and generative models powered by LLMs and GFlowNets.

###### GFlowNets for Decision Making
During my PhD, I am investigating how Generative Flow Networks can be leveraged to sample diverse, high-reward decisions in uncertain environments. I applied these methods in diverse areas such as music generation, code fuzzing, and autonomous testing.

###### Adversarial Robustness and Evaluation
As a Research Associate at the University of Waterloo AI Institute, I developed adversarial testing pipelines using CARLA and kernel density-based classifiers to distinguish threats in autonomous driving. I also proposed novel adversarial patches and scene-level defenses during my work at TrojAI Inc.

###### Neural Network Privacy and Verification
At MBZUAI, I analyzed privacy vulnerabilities in spiking neural networks under membership inference attacks and proposed systematic evaluation frameworks, integrating insights from formal methods and empirical risk.

###### Physical World Attacks and Defenses
My Master's work focused on defending CNNs from physical corruptions using multi-patch attacks and low-cost defenses. I have published extensively on attack taxonomies and image-space defenses.
